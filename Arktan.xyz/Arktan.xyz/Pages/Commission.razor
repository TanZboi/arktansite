    <h1>Natkra Commission Info</h1>
    <h1>Prices & TOS</h1>

    <p>Please make yourself familiar with all the information below before asking for a commission! :)</p>
    <p>I am 19, at university, and I have a job , so please have patience if I take a while to respond at first. I will only start a commission when I know I have time :) </p>
    <p>I live in the UK (BST). </p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Interested?</strong><br>
        Message me on discord at <em>‘arktanz’</em><br>
        <strong>Commissions are always open, however I don't take on many at a time. Message me on discord to check my availability :)</strong> </p>

    <p>Average commission time is: <br>
        7 - 14 days(ish) for lineart <br>
        5 - 7 days(ish) for colouring and shading. </p>
    <p>Please allow up to three weeks in total from start to finish :) I have a part time job and I go to university to please be patient if it takes a while. I’ll always put commissions as a higher priority in the later stage once you’ve paid for it.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>My commissions cost the same for half body view, ¾ view and full bodys. </p>

    <br><br/>

    <p>1. I will begin working on a commission as soon as I can. I will then make simple and rough lineart, which I will send to you with a <strong>watermark</strong>.</p>
    <p>2. You can then ask for any changes you would like, as long as they <strong>aren't too drastic</strong> (e.g completely different pose). <strong>Payment isn’t required</strong> until after you’re happy with your lineart.</p>
    <p>3. Once payment is complete, I will send over the <strong>un-watermarked lineart</strong> and I will finish the artwork.</p>
    <p>4. Once I've finished you can then ask for any more slight changes to do with colouring or shading, or any other final touches.</p>

    <br><br/>

    <p>Payment is by <strong>PayPal invoice</strong> only, so I’ll need your email address when it comes to this stage. I’ll always let you know how much it’ll be before starting :)</p>

    <p>Please know what you want before you ask for a commission! I unfortunately suck at coming up with ideas so I can’t help you.</p>
    <p>I can refuse any commission for any reason. </p>
    <p>There are <strong>No refunds</strong> once you’ve sent payment.</p>

    <h2>Commission Tiers and Content</h2>
    <p>important stuff :) </p>

    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Things I am good at</th>
            <th>Things I will not do (feel free to ask though!)</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>General character art (everything you see in my gallery)<br>Anthro<br>SFW<br>NSFW</td>
            <td>Ref Sheets<br>Fetish art (feel free to ask - I may refuse, but I never judge.)<br>Animation<br>Super complex perspective or character design, including complex armour, outfits or machinery.<br>Gore<br>Homophobia, racism etc..<br>Feral art</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>~ Profile Pictures ~</h2>
    <p class="price">£15 GBP</p>
    <p>Just a headshot. I’ll spend extra time on the details of the face for you to make sure it looks good as a very small image.</p>

    <img src="art/commissionart/Untitled-1.png" alt="Profile Picture Example 1">

    <h2>~ Simple Shading & colouring ~</h2>
    <p class="price">£25 GBP</p>
    <p>A full drawing of your character of choice. I’ll shade and colour simply, with a thick outline to show depth. I’ll also do a simple background if you like, or you could have a transparent png background. </p>

    <img src="art/commissionart/Untitled-2.png" alt="Simple Shading Example 1">

    <h2>~ Tier 3 (Complex Shading & colouring) ~</h2>
    <p class="price">£35 GBP</p>
    <p>Full character drawing in any pose you like. I’ll spend a lot of time on the shading and colouring, also with a simple background if you’d like. </p>

    <img src="art/commissionart/Untitled-3.png" alt="Complex Shading Example 1">


    <p>For all tiers, each extra character adds on 50% of the original commission price. <br>
        For example: 1 character is £35 <br>
        2 characters are £35 + (£35*0.5) = £52.50 <br>
        3 characters are £52.50 + (£35*0.5) = £69.75 </p>

    <h2>Posting, sharing and editing</h2>
    <p>If you get a commission from me, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Post and share it wherever you like.</li>
        <li>Crop, edit, trace, redraw, or change the artwork any way you want.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The only things you <strong>can’t do</strong> are: <strong>use it commercially</strong> to make money, or <strong>pretend you drew it yourself</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you post it, please either: credit me as the artist, or make sure that my signature is visible in the image :))</p>
